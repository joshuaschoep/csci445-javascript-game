One of our biggest challenges was related to version control. Using vanilla JavaScript and no backend,
it's functionally impossible to link together separate files so we were forced to write all of our scripts
in the one large 'blasteroids.js' file. This was relatively inconvenient when we wanted to have multiple
team members working on the project at the same time.

We also struggled with keeping track of variables and other typing in the class structure of our program
due to JavaScripts weak (or nonexistant) typing. There's also no real inheritance in JavaScript, so our
code struggled a bit with keeping everything in order.

Our project should be worth 100 points because we implemented some complex features of javascript, html, and css
into a coherent and visually appealing web-based game. We found workarounds to common javascript issues like async,
callbacks, objects and classes/inheritence, and game mechanics like event-ticks and collision systems.
